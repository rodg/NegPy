# Roadmap

- Keyboard shortcuts.
- Metadata editor (save filmstock, developer, scanning etc.)
- Look into better automatic dust removal using IR layer.
- UI refinements.
- Filmstock crosstalk & paper simulation preset support.
- E-6 Mode for editing positives.
- Look into GPU Acceleration? Current processing is highly optimized but using GPU for some calculation should be even faster.
- Revisit parallelism for batch processing (scrapped before public release due to potential stability / memory issues.)
- Algorithm fine-tuning.
- Whatever comes to mind next.
